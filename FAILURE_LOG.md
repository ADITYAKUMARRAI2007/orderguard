# Failure Log

Written **as failures happen**. Never reconstructed from memory afterwards.
This file is part of the buildathon submission — the application asks
"what broke, and how you got out," and Razorpay says it is the answer they read first.

## F-001 — Shell variables did not survive between command blocks

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Checkpoint:** CP-0 (caught in review, before execution)
**Command:** planned Step 6 — `sed "s/__ORDER_ID__/$OID/; s/__KEY__/$RZP_KEY_ID/"`

### What I expected
`$OID` from Step 5 and `$RZP_KEY_ID` from `.env` to be available in Step 6.

### What happened
Caught during plan review, not at runtime. Each command block runs in a fresh shell,
so `$OID` was gone and Step 6 never sourced `.env` at all — **both** variables would
have been empty. The checkout page would have rendered with blank `order_id` and `key`
and failed confusingly rather than loudly.

### Root cause
Assumed shell state persists across separate command invocations. It does not.

### Fix
Step 5 persists the order ID to `probe/order_id.txt`. Step 6 re-sources `.env`
and reloads the file with `tr -d '\n' < probe/order_id.txt`.

### Regression test
Not code — a documented rule: **every command block re-sources `.env` and reloads
state from disk.** Applies to every checkpoint.

### What I learned
Silent empty-string substitution is worse than a hard error. Prefer commands that
fail loudly on missing state.

### Could this happen in production?
Yes — the same class of bug appears in CI pipelines and shell-based deploys.

### Remaining limitation
`probe/` is gitignored, so the order ID is not reproducible from a fresh clone.
Acceptable: it is a throwaway probe artefact.

## F-002 — Unconditional `cp` overwrote the user's `.env`

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Checkpoint:** CP-0
**Command:** `cp .env.example .env` (during the Gemini provider switch)

### What I expected
To refresh the `.env` template with provider-neutral field names.

### What happened
`.env` was overwritten unconditionally, destroying any credentials already
pasted into it. The earlier command in the same checkpoint was guarded
(`test -f .env || cp .env.example .env`) — the second one was not. Detected when
a field-status check showed all three credential fields empty after the user
reported having filled them in.

### Root cause
Two commands doing the same job, only one of them idempotent. The unguarded
variant silently destroyed user data instead of refusing.

### How I proved the root cause
`awk` field-status dump showed `RZP_KEY_ID`, `RZP_KEY_SECRET` and `LLM_API_KEY`
all empty, while `LLM_PROVIDER` and `LLM_MODEL` held the template defaults —
exactly the signature of a fresh copy from `.env.example`.

### Fix
`.env` is never written by a command again. Values are edited in place with
`Edit`, or the user edits the file directly. Any future template refresh must
merge, never replace.

### Regression test
Not code — a standing rule recorded here and in `SECURITY.md`:
**no command may write to `.env`.**

### What I learned
Destructive commands must be idempotent by default. `cp` over a credentials file
is a data-loss operation and should never appear unguarded. A guarded variant
existing three commands earlier made the unguarded one look safe by association.

### Could this happen in production?
Yes. This is the classic deploy-script bug that overwrites production config with
a template.

### Remaining limitation
If the Razorpay secret was pasted before the overwrite, it cannot be recovered —
Razorpay displays the secret only once. A new test key must be generated.
